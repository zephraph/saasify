## Demo

Here is a live [SaaS API and marketing site](https://imagemin.saasify.sh ':target=_blank') by Sindre Sorhus that was auto-generated with Saasify from this [source code](https://github.com/saasify-sh/saasify/tree/master/examples/typescript/imagemin ':target=_blank').

We make it really simple to "saasify" your own projects like this one.

## Why Saasify?

We built Saasify as an ideal solution for developers who want to earn passive income from their side projects.

The only real way to validate a SaaS idea is to ship an MVP and get real customers paying for it. That's why Saasify allows you to quickly ship a quality MVP and start monetizing in minutes instead of months. ‚úàÔ∏è

We've helped dozens of SaaS products get off the ground by enabling them to focus only on their unique value instead of SaaS boilerplate. üî•

## What can be monetized using Saasify?

Any externally hosted REST API can be monetized via Saasify. We also provide built-in support for monetizing serverless functions.

Some example use cases include:

- Workflow automation (headless chrome / bots)
- Image & media processing tasks
- Data transformations
- General algorithms
- Pre-built machine learning models
- Your NPM module or PyPI package?

Check out the [showcase](https://docs.saasify.sh/#/showcase) for more live examples of projects which have been saasified.
